I don't care that that's a third-party appliwhoozitz!\r\n\r\nThis is all simple stuff and it's probably coded right into your templates. Changing it is easy enough, but requires a developer and then a release. Boo!\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nJust add `addendum_tags` to your templates:\r\n\r\n```django\r\n{% load addendum_tags %}\r\n\r\n{% snippet 'home:greeting' %}Hi!{% endsnippet %} {{ user.first_name }}\r\n\r\n<footer>\r\n  {% snippet 'home:footer' %}&copy; 2011 by Acme Corp.{% endsnippet %}\r\n</footer>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can edit content for these placeholders from the admin interface. If you don't add anything or you delete text, the site text will always revert to what is in the template.\r\n\r\nUse it for small bits of user modifiable text from any template on your site, and for swapping out *lorem ipsum* text when prototyping.\r\n\r\nFind some more [information in the docs](https://django-addendum.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nInstall the package from PyPI:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npip install django-addendum\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd it to your `INSTALLED_APPS` tuple:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nINSTALLED_APPS += ('addendum')\r\n```\r\n\r\nSync your database or migrate if you have `South\r\n<south.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ installed.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nBSD licensed.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
